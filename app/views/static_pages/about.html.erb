      Food Hero is an app connecting those who need food with those who are able to provide it. By using a simple, mobile-friendly interface that connects organizations with volunteers and non-profits, we aim to reduce some of the 20-45% of food waste in the U.S. In 2014 about 15% of Americans were food insecure, according to Feeding America, given that such a large percentage of food is wasted, we hope to be a part of the solution. With our app both donors and organizations can create a login, then use web or mobile to see a list of donations or donation requests, and associated ratings, location, and contact info.
